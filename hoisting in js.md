### Hoisting in JS 


Basically when javascript compiles the code, all the variables declared using var are hoisted/lifted to the top of their functional/local scope (if declared inside a function) or to the top of their global scope (if declared outside of a function) regardless of where the actual declaration has been made. This is what we mean by “hoisting”.
